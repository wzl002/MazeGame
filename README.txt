# MAZE GAME
This game is a first person memory game in which you are to try and navigate your way through a randomly generated maze with tall walls in the hopes of finding the exit. 

You will begin the game and spawn on a floor tile labeled "START". There will be an enemy entity that will spawn with you and will randomly walk around throughout the maze with very minimalistic AI behaviour. However there is no real purpose to his existence other than "just because". 

Try to find the floor tile labeled "EXIT" to win the game. As of right now, there is no ending for the game aside from the personal satisfaction of reaching the exit, in which case you may restart the game and face another completely random maze. 

# Pong Game
This game comes from the classical pong game, which is one of the first computer games that ever created. This game has two paddles and a ball. A player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball, and the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain target points. The game can be played with two players or one player against a computer.

# Getting Started
Build the game for either PS4 or Windows using Unity. Run the file and either have a keyboard and mouse for windows, or a PS4 Controller ready to play. A PS4 may or may not work correctly on a windows build. 

# CONTROLS
you are able to move your character in any direction you like by using the various sets of [MOVE] controls, 
as well as moving the camera in all directions by using the [CAMERA] controls.

you can trun on or off a flashlight by using the [FLASHLIGHT] controls.

You can change the lighting of the game from day to night and vice versa, via the key or button corresponding to the [LIGHTING] control. It will also switch the background music.

You can toggle the game's fog on or off by hitting the key or button corresponding to the [FOG] control. When fog on, the background music volume will reduce.

You can fire a ball to the enemy by using the [FIRE] controls. If you hit the enemy, you will get the scores.

You can save your position and scores by using the [SAVE] controls. You will start at the saved position when you play the game next time. You can also return to the saved position by using [LOAD] controls.

You can stop or play the background music by using the [STOP/PLAY MUSIC] controls.

You can toggle collision with the maze walls by using the [WALLCOLLIDE] control. This will allow you to switch whether you can walk through walls or not.  No key map for this on PS4.

You can switch to a PONG GAME by hitting the entrance wall. After you finish one round, you will go back to the maze.

In the Pong game, you can move the left paddle by using the [LEFT PADDLE] controls.
