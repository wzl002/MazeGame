# MAZE GAME
This game is a first person memory game in which you are to try and navigate your way through a randomly generated maze with tall walls in the hopes of finding the exit. 

You will begin the game and spawn on a floor tile labeled "START". There will be an enemy entity that will spawn with you and will randomly walk around throughout the maze with very minimalistic AI behaviour. However there is no real purpose to his existence other than "just because". 

Try to find the floor tile labeled "EXIT" to win the game. As of right now, there is no ending for the game aside from the personal satisfaction of reaching the exit, in which case you may restart the game and face another completely random maze. 

# Pong Game
This game comes from the classical pong game, which is one of the first computer games that ever created. This game has two paddles and a ball. A player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball, and the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain target points. The game can be played with two players or one player against a computer.

# Getting Started
Build the game for either PS4 or Windows using Unity. Run the file and either have a keyboard and mouse for windows, or a PS4 Controller ready to play. A PS4 may or may not work correctly on a windows build. 

# CONTROLS

as well as moving the camera in all directions by using the [CAMERA] controls.
