# Pong Game
This game comes from the classical pong game, which is one of the first computer games that ever created. This game has two paddles and a ball. A player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball, and the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain target points. The game can be played with two players or one player against a computer.

The paddles can also be controlled by two joysticks on PS4 controllers.
